# Predicting Water Pump Functionality In Tanzania
This study evaluated four machine learning algo- rithms - Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbours, and Artificial Neural Networks - for predicting the functionality status of rural water pumps in Tanzania using data from the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. Extensive data preprocessing like imputation, discretization, feature selection, and oversampling were applied. The Random Forest algorithm performed best, achieving 74% accuracy and 66.3% balanced accuracy in classifying pumps as functional, non-functional, or functional requiring repairs. It excelled at capturing complex relationships between features like location, construction details, and management factors. XGBoost also showed strong results with 68.4% accuracy. The ensemble learning techniques outperformed other methods on this challenging prediction task involving highly categorical data. The findings can guide resource allocation and maintenance efforts for Tanzaniaâ€™s water infrastructure.
